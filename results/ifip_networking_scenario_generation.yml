# Note that in the evaluation the scenarios with 20 requests were not considered, as for these at time not a single
# request was feasible and the number of feasible scenarios in general is very small. The results were not really meaningful.
# Accordingly, our evaluation only reports on the scenarios with 40, 60, 80, or 100 requests (yielding 1500 scenarios overall).
